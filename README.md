Image Compression using PR Quad Tree.
Quad Tree is used to save the image.The last level of the quad Tree has the image details which is not compressed.The last but one level will have the image details which is compressed 1/4.The basic idea is to take 4 pixels and then average over the RGB values of these four pixels to make one pixel.The second last level will have 1/16 compressed image and similarly for any upper level.
Ping for any help.
There are numerous videos on youtube on quadtrees which can help you understand the data structure as well as how to use it for image compression.
